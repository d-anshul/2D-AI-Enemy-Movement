# Enemy AI Movement
 
A simple 2D top-down game written in Scala with AI-controlled enemy characters. The game allows players to control a character, move using "WASD" or arrow keys, and fire projectiles with the space bar. The central focus of this project lies in the implementation of AI logic for the enemy characters, which leverages the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for enhanced gameplay.
